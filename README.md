trying to implement the risk-tracking ideas gained from tool failures



# practical application of the Risk Quantification and Register Tool

## Overview
This tool is designed to assess, quantify, and prioritize risks associated with third-party integrations and internal assets. It enables security teams to track baseline deviations, estimate financial impact, and manage critical dependencies. Integrating threat modeling frameworks like STRIDE and MITRE ATT&CK, this tool helps in detailed risk context mapping and prioritization.

## Features
- **Questionnaire Interface**: Gathers security information from business tech owners to inform risk calculations.
- **Risk Register Management**: Maintains updated risk scores, baseline comparisons, and priority rankings for third-party profiles.
- **Baseline Tracking with Continuous Monitoring Integration**: Tracks security baseline drift and integrates findings from continuous monitoring.
- **Threat Modeling with STRIDE and MITRE ATT&CK**: Maps risks to common threats for better prioritization.
- **Cost and Financial Impact Analysis**: Estimates potential financial impact and cost-benefit of mitigations.
- **Dependency Mapping**: Assesses dependencies to prioritize high-impact risks.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository/risk-quantification-register-tool.git
    cd risk-quantification-register-tool
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configuration**:
   - Open `config.json` to define risk factors, baseline thresholds, and third-party profiles.
   - Adjust thresholds and compliance requirements as necessary.

## Usage
1. **Run the Questionnaire Interface**:
    ```bash
    python questionnaire_interface.py
    ```
   - Collects questionnaire responses, maps to risk factors, and creates entries in the risk register.

2. **Update the Risk Register**:
    ```bash
    python risk_register.py
    ```
   - Creates or updates risk entries based on updated assessments, including baseline drift checks.

3. **Baseline Tracking**:
    ```bash
    python baseline_tracker.py
    ```
   - Integrates with continuous monitoring data and updates the baseline status.

4. **Run Threat Modeling**:
    ```bash
    python threat_modeling.py
    ```
   - Maps risk factors to STRIDE and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks for threat context.

5. **Priority Assignment Using Matrix**:
    ```bash
    python priority_matrix.py
    ```
   - Assigns priority levels to risks based on severity and urgency.

6. **Cost Impact Analysis**:
    ```bash
    python cost_impact_analysis.py
    ```
   - Calculates financial impact estimates and cost-benefit ratios for mitigation strategies.

7. **Dependency Mapping**:
    ```bash
    python dependency_mapper.py
    ```
   - Maps and logs dependencies for each profile, updating the risk register with dependency impact scores.

## Configuration
- **config.json**: Defines risk weights, third-party profiles, baseline thresholds, and compliance mapping.

## Additional Files
1. **requirements.txt**: Lists dependencies for easy installation.
2. **logging_config.py**: Configures centralized logging for all scripts.
3. **alert_manager.py**: Sends alerts for critical risks and baseline drift via email or Slack.

## Example `config.json` Configuration
```json
{
    "risk_factors": {
        "data_sensitivity": 5,
        "access_level": 3,
        "compliance_impact": 4
    },
    "third_party_profiles": [
        {
            "name": "Vendor A",
            "baseline": "Moderate",
            "dependencies": ["Critical System X", "API Service Y"]
        }
    ]
}
```
